<h1>Description</h1>
Arch Linux Installation Script (ALIS) is a script that helps you to configur and install your Arch from scratch.

<h1>Install</h1>

In the terminal use the following command :
<code>git clone https://github.com/shawn226/install-arch-linux</code>

You need to make the script executable :
<code>chmod +x install_arch_linux\ -\ part\ 1.sh</code>

You only have to execute the first script (which will call the second)
